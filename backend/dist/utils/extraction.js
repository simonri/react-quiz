  //   "(As of |On|In|Effective|Dated)" means that the results should contains one of these text "As of" or "On" or "In" or "Effective" or "Dated".
  //   "([^\.<>]*)" can be split into two parts "[^\.<>]" and "*". The first part "[^\.<>]" means that the results should not contains a dot (.) or any HTML tags that we can identify from these characters "<" or ">". So the results can contain any character except for a dot "." or "<" or ">". More technical details about this syntax, the "[^X]" means that the results should never contain any element from X (where X is a list of single characters). The second part is "*" which is always applied to the first part and which means "zero or more occurrences of preceding character". So this text is valid ". On December 2004, there was something." and also this text is valid ". On the last period of December 2004, there was something." thanks to this condition "([^\.<>]*)".
  //   "(January|Jan\.|February|Feb\.|March|Mar\.|April|Apr\.|May|June|Jun\.|July|Jul\.|August|Aug\.|September|Sep\.|October|Oct\.|November|Nov\.|December|Dec\.)" means that the results should contains one of these text "January" or "Jan." or "February" or "Feb." or "March" or "Mar." or "April" or "Apr." or "May" or "June" or "Jun." or "July". or "Jul." or "September" or "Sep." or "October" or "Oct." or "Nomvember" or "Nov." or "December" or "Dec."
  //   "([^<>]*)" means that the text can contain anything except for "<" or ">"
  //   "(\.|;))" means that the result should contains a dot "." or a ";".
  // To summarize what this regular expression search for: it search for a dot ".", then a blank space, then one of these text "As of" or "On" or "In", then search for any occurence that does not contain "." or "<" or ">" multiple time and then search for the month names "January" or "Jan." until "December" or "Dec.", then search again for any occurence that does not contain "." or "<" or ">" multiple time until and finally meet a dot "." or a ";" character.
