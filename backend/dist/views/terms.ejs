      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>By using the FilingFindings.com web site ("Service"), or any services of FilingFindings™, you are agreeing to
          be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service"). IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT
          ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY,
          ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN
          WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
          IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT
          THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
        <p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While FilingFindings™
          prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that FilingFindings™ cannot be
          responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You
          agree to use the Service at your own risk</p>

        <h3>Account Terms</h3>

          complete the signup process.</p>
        <p>Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted.</p>

        <p>FilingFindings™, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any
          and all current or future use of the Service, or any other FilingFindings™ service, for any reason at any
          time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your
          access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. FilingFindings™
          reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

        <h3>Payment, Refunds, Upgrading Downgrading and Cancellation Terms</h3>
        <p>All paid plans must enter a valid payment method. Free accounts, if offered, are not required to provide a
          payment method or alternative.</p>
        <p>An upgrade from a free account to any paying plan will immediately bill you, unless your account is still in
          the Trial Period, in which case you will be billed immediately upon completion of the Trial Period.</p>

          annual payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a yearly basis and is non-refundable. There will be
          no refunds for partial periods of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for days unused with an open
          account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>
        <p>When changing from a MONTHLY billing cycle to an annual billing cycle, FilingFindings™ will immediately bill
          for a full year less any account credit. You will immediately receive credit prorated for any remaining time
          left in your MONTHLY billing period.</p>
        <p>When changing from an ANNUAL billing cycle to a monthly billing cycle, FilingFindings™ will immediately bill

          time left in your ANNUAL billing period.</p>
        <p>Credit will automatically be applied against any amounts billed. There will be no refunds for unused account
          credit.</p>
        <p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be
          responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state)
          taxes.</p>
        <p>For any upgrade or downgrade in a paid plan level while on a MONTHLY billing cycle, you will immediately be
          charged or credited with the difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your MONTHLY billing
          cycle.</p>
        <p>For any upgrade or downgrade in a paid plan level while on an ANNUAL billing cycle, you will immediately be
          charged or credited with the difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your ANNUAL billing
          cycle.</p>
        <p>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account.
          FilingFindings™ does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
        <p>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect
